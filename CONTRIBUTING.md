## Introduction
This document explains how to contribute to the [EyesOfNetwork](http://www.eyesofnetwork.com) notifier project.  
This is a production ready project, assuming this, all changes willn't accepted if cause code or functionnality regression.

## Maintainers
This part of [EyesOfNetwork](http://www.eyesofnetwork.com) solution is maintained essentialy by one person.  
All of team can review and help us on issue.

## Bug reports
Please, ensure you've already search into issue tracker than your issue not already exist or will be solved.

## Add functionnalities or bug correction
To actively contribute to this project, you could generate pull request to include your modifications if you think this is needed to merged into standard project.  
We work with pull request to integrate new functionnalities. This permit us to review proposed change, discuss on it, check it, modify it, and validate or not the change.

Somes conditions to create pull request :
  1. You'll don't break existing code.
  2. You'll don't cause ANY regression (speed or functionnalities).
  3. On released version, only security correctives could be merged. No functionnalities adds.
  4. You'll only pass by repository fork and pull request to add something.

How to contribute :
  1. Fork master branch
  2. Update project into your fork
  3. Create pull request

## Sign your work
When you add or modify code, please, just sign your commit with your real name.

```
Or if you've GPG key, directly sign your commit with it by a simple `git commit -S`

## Versionning
To generate new releases of project, we work on not finished code into specific branch sur as `release/v2.1-1`.  
This method permit to not break master branch with new code, and to follow much easier new changes.

When new release is finished to write, we merge it onto master branch, we create new tag `2.1-1` and drop branch.
